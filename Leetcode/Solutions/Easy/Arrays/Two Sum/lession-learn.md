### What is Big O Notation?

Think of **Big O Notation** as a way to describe how much time (or memory) an algorithm takes as the input data gets bigger. It's not about exact seconds, but more about the  *growth rate* . We usually care about the **worst-case scenario** – when the algorithm takes the longest.

### Diving into **O**(**n**2)

**O**(**n**2) is pronounced "Big O of n squared." This means the algorithm's runtime grows proportional to the **square of the input size** (**n**).

Let's use our `TwoSum` function as an example. If our input array has **n** elements:

* The **outer loop** (using `i`) runs about **n** times.
* The **inner loop** (using `j`) runs about **n** times for *each* run of the outer loop.

Since the inner loop is *nested* inside the outer loop, the total number of operations (like comparisons) is roughly **n**×**n**=**n**2.

**Quick examples to see the pattern:**

* If **n**=**10** elements, roughly **1**0**2**=**100** operations.
* If **n**=**100** elements, roughly **10**0**2**=**10**,**000** operations.
* If **n**=**1000** elements, roughly **100**0**2**=**1**,**000**,**000** operations.

You can really see how fast the number of operations skyrockets when **n** gets larger. This makes **O**(**n**2) algorithms **inefficient** for big datasets.

### How **O**(**n**2) Stacks Up Against Others

It helps to compare **O**(**n**2) with other common Big O complexities:

***O**(**1**) (Constant): Super fast. Time taken is always the same, no matter the input size. (Like accessing an array element by its index).

***O**(**log**n) (Logarithmic): Really efficient. Time grows very slowly. (Think binary search).

***O**(**n**) (Linear): Good. Time grows directly with input size. (Like looping through an array once).

***O**(**n**lo**g**n): Solid performance, much better than **O**(**n**2). Often seen in efficient sorting algorithms (like Merge Sort).

***O**(**n**3) (Cubic): Even slower than **O**(**n**2).

### When **O**(**n**2) Is Actually Okay

Even though **O**(**n**2) isn't top-tier for efficiency, sometimes it's perfectly fine:

***Small `n`:** If you know for sure your array size will always be small (say, a few dozen elements max), the performance difference compared to more complex algorithms isn't a big deal. Plus, **O**(**n**2) code is often simpler and easier to understand.

***Simplicity Wins:** Sometimes, the **O**(**n**2) solution is the most straightforward way to solve a problem. If the problem doesn't demand super high performance, adding a lot of complexity to optimize might not be worth it.

So, while it's good to know about efficiency, it's also about choosing the right tool for the job!
